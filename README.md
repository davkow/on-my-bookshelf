# on-my-bookshelf Documentation

A RESTful API service for managing a virtual bookshelf. Use to track your books: what you've read, lent out, and also add your own rating. This API can be integrated with applications that allow people to track their books. 

This is a mock API designed to simulate the REST interface of an imaginary service.

For the API documentation, see [on-my-bookshelf API](https://davkow.github.io/on-my-bookshelf/)
