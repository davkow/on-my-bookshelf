# on-my-bookshelf Documentation

A RESTful API service for managing a virtual bookshelf. This API can be integrated with applications that allow people to track their books. It can also be used as part of a more social lending library application where you can also track lending and borrowing of books.

This is a mock API is designed to simulate the REST interface of an imaginary service.
